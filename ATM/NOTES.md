# ATM — Notes

The second portion of the kiosk: an ATM where Gen Alpha users learn to
use an ATM, plus general money tips and slide-style lessons. Separate
from the mobile-app kiosk that every other group in this repo serves.

## Brand colours

| Name | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Navy | `#002c44` | Primary, dominant |
| Teal | `#059390` | Primary |
| Light teal | `#3bbfc0` | Glows, shimmer |
| Light blue | `#0079a9` | Glows |
| Midnight | `#11232d` | Dark contrast |
| Egg yolk | `#ffcc40` | Accent only (the tap icon's ripple) |

## Current

- `ATMWingBackground.tsx` — the ATM screen's animated wing background
  (the attract/home state). Drop it inside the ATM artwork, sized to
  the screen cutout; the artwork is drawn on a 499×465 canvas and
  scaled to cover the layer. Built from the 8 curves of the design's
  wing SVG:
  - Lines 5–6 edge **wing 1**, lines 2–3 edge **wing 2**. Each wing is
    one solid shape. Lines 1, 4, 7 and 8 are still **accent lines**
    and never animate (a travelling highlight on them was tried and
    dropped).
  - **Style → Flow**: both wings tilt and lift together, in sync, as
    rigid shapes (they never change shape). An earlier version bent
    the curves themselves; the brief is no morphing.
  - **Style → Aurora**: nothing moves; the light inside each shape
    slowly rolls across it, and the glows drift a little wider.
  - Both: three soft glows (light teal top right at half strength,
    light blue upper left and lower middle) and a light-teal shimmer
    running left to right along the wing lines.
  - Background: a very wide navy-to-teal blend, tilted 14° upward (navy
    lower left, teal upper right). Navy holds to 60% of the blend and the
    blend runs past the right edge, so most of the frame is navy. Gradients are
    expanded into many eased stops so no colour change has a visible
    starting line. Navy (`#002c44`) is the dominant colour.
  - **Seamless loop**: everything is a function of one phase that runs
    0 → 2π per loop at whole-number frequencies, and the shimmer is a
    repeating band shifted by exactly one period, so the last frame
    equals the first. No still shape shares an edge with a wing, so no
    edge shows double while the wings move.
  - Colours only change when a property changes; each animation frame
    only sets transforms and opacities on a few elements. Honours
    reduced motion (shows a still frame). Unique gradient ids per
    instance via `useId`.
  - Colour properties accept anything Framer passes: hex (short or
    long), `rgb()`/`rgba()`, and project colour styles, which arrive as
    `var(--token-…, <colour>)` (`toRgb` reads the colour after the
    comma). Before this was handled, picking a colour style read digits
    from the token's id and gave wrong, neon colours in the gradients
    and glows. Colour alpha is ignored; each shape has its own opacity.
  - Known and accepted: most of wing 2's bottom line (line 2) runs below
    the screen, so its shimmer is only seen near the bottom-right
    corner.
- `ATMTapIcon.tsx` — the "Tap anywhere to begin" icon, its own
  component (icon only, no background or text). The designer's outline
  hand holds still in white; a soft egg-yolk glow at the **index
  fingertip** breathes and sends out **two stroke rings**, one shortly
  after the other (2.8 s loop). The view is cropped tight to the hand
  and the largest ring, with no padding (about 300×332 at Ripple
  Size 1), so the frame's edges are the icon's edges.
  Ripple size is option A from the preview: the rings grow to about
  1.5× the hand's height across (**Ripple Size** = 1). Under the OS
  "reduce motion" setting it shows the hand with a still glow.

## Using it in Framer

- Paste `ATMWingBackground.tsx` into a code file in the Framer project
  and drop the component into the ATM's screen cutout. To pick up a
  change from this repo, paste the latest version of the file over the
  old one; placed instances keep their property values.
- Colours can be typed in or picked from the project's colour styles;
  both work (see the colour note above).
- The **Style** property is named `motionStyle` in code, not `style`:
  Framer passes its own `style` prop to every code component, and a
  property with that name would clash with it.
- Under the OS "reduce motion" setting it shows one still frame.
- `ATMTapIcon.tsx` works the same way: paste it into its own code file
  and place it over the background. Keep its frame at the icon's
  shape (about 300×332 at Ripple Size 1); other shapes letterbox it,
  centred. Its colours
  (**Hand**, **Ripple**) also accept colour styles.

## Checking a change before handing it over

- The loop must stay seamless: any new motion has to be a function of
  the loop phase θ at a whole-number frequency (`cos(k·θ)`,
  `sin(k·θ)`), or repeat exactly once per loop like the shimmer. A
  quick check is to compare `frameAt(θ, settings)` with
  `frameAt(θ + 2π, settings)`: every value must match.
- Try the colour properties with a colour style as well as a typed hex
  value; the gradients and glows should look the same either way.

## Where to change things (`ATMWingBackground.tsx`)

Most tuning is a property in Framer's panel; the rest is a constant
near the top of the file.

| Feedback | Where |
|---|---|
| Flow or Aurora | **Style** property |
| Speed of the loop | **Loop (s)** property (default 12 s) |
| How far the wings tilt / how far the light rolls | **Movement** property; tilt is `amp * 3` degrees and lift `amp * 6` in `frameAt` |
| Easing | **Easing** property |
| Glow brightness, all glows | **Glow** property |
| One glow brighter/dimmer, moved, recoloured | `ORBS`: `x`/`y` position, `r` size, `color`, `k` strength (top right is `k: 0.5`) |
| Glow softness | `FALLOFF` (fade curve) and the `glowSoft` blur (`stdDeviation={55}`) |
| Wing shimmer brightness / count | **Wing Shimmer**, **Shimmers / Loop** properties; colour is Light Teal |
| More or less navy in the background | `BG`: navy holds to the second key (`0.6`); the blend runs to `x = 680` (larger = more navy at the right edge) |
| Angle of the background blend | `BG_ANGLE` (degrees upward toward the right; `0` is horizontal) |
| Colour mix inside a wing or still shape | `grad` keys on `WINGS` / `FILLS` (`[offset, colour]`); `g` is the gradient direction |
| Brand colours | **Navy / Teal / Light Teal / Light Blue / Midnight** properties |
| Hide lines | **Wing Lines**, **Accent Lines** properties |
| A picked colour shows up wrong | `toRgb` (how a Framer colour value is read) |

## Where to change things (`ATMTapIcon.tsx`)

| Feedback | Where |
|---|---|
| Ripple bigger/smaller | **Ripple Size** property (1 = option A, about 1.5× the hand's height) |
| Speed of the loop | **Loop (s)** property (default 2.8 s) |
| Hand or ripple colour | **Hand**, **Ripple** properties (ripple is egg yolk) |
| Gap between the two rings | `RING_GAP` (share of the loop) |
| Ring / glow thickness or size | `RING_STROKE`, `RING_START`, `GLOW_R` |
| Where the ripple starts | `TIP` (in the hand SVG's 1788×2500 units) |

## How it was made

Claude Code skills used along the way (they shaped the previews and the
approach more than the component's code):

- **design-taste-frontend**: invoked by the designer at the start. It
  guided the early calls: asking about colours instead of guessing,
  avoiding generic defaults, honouring reduced motion, and only
  animating position and opacity so it runs smoothly. (`gpt-taste`
  was named in the same request but never loaded.)
- **artifact-design**: came with the Artifact tool when building the
  two preview pages (the tuning page and the side-by-side component
  page): their layout, typography and publishing rules.
- **ponytail**: a mode that was on for the session, not called on
  purpose. It pushes toward the simplest code that works, which is why
  the component is one self-contained file with no new libraries.

No skill wrote the component itself. It is SVG shapes and gradients
built from the wing SVG's curves, in a React code component following
this repo's conventions (Framer property controls, `useReducedMotion`
from framer-motion, which Framer already provides). One loop phase
drives all the motion, which is what makes the loop seamless. Checks
used esbuild to compile it and Playwright with Chromium to render it,
screenshot it and compare frames pixel by pixel (seamless loop, the
14° tilt, the colour-style fix).

## Decisions log (so feedback doesn't undo them by accident)

In the order they were made with the designer:

- **Brief**: replace the old diagonal blue lines with an animated wing;
  filled, layered shapes with no harsh lines; seamless loop with no
  stops; vibrant light and pulsing glows. Brand colours: navy `#002c44`
  and teal `#059390` (primary), light teal `#3bbfc0` and light blue
  `#0079a9` (glows), midnight `#11232d` (dark contrast).
- **No "Tap anywhere to begin" in this component.** That is a separate
  layer to build later (finger icon looping into a tap-ripple).
- **Four styles were explored**: Breathe (layers sway), Flow, Light
  trails (comets along the lines), Aurora. **Flow** was chosen;
  **Aurora** kept as the second option.
- **No morphing.** The first Flow bent the curves; the shapes must keep
  their exact form. A very subtle "tilt only" version was rejected as
  too subtle, so Flow keeps a clear wingbeat, done as rigid motion.
- **The two wings move in sync** (same transform at the same moment).
- **Accent lines (1, 4, 7, 8) never move** and have **no animation at
  all**: a shimmer and then a travelling highlight along them were both
  tried and rejected.
- **Double-wing fix**: still shapes that shared an edge with a moving
  wing made each wing edge show twice; they were removed.
- **Wing shimmer**: left to right along the wing lines, light teal.
  Mint `#bce2d7` was tried and rejected. It must be continuous (a
  single sweep left a visible gap/restart each loop).
- **Glows**: very diffused, spread over the frame (not only the
  bottom); lower middle is light blue; top right is half strength.
- **Colour balance**: navy is the dominant colour, more than teal.
  Teal only toward the right. The background blend runs left to right,
  tilted about 14° upward (navy lower left, teal upper right); the
  shapes' own gradients follow each shape (making every gradient
  horizontal was tried and rejected). No light-blue stripe between navy
  and teal (it read as a harsh band). Every gradient is eased so there
  is no visible line where a colour starts.
- **How far navy holds in the background** was pushed out step by step:
  the blend first started around 40%, then navy held to 45%, 50%, and
  finally **60%** of the gradient (current). The background is also
  stretched past the right edge (`x = 680`) so the right edge stays
  mostly navy, and tilted **14°** upward (`BG_ANGLE`).
- **Accepted as is**: wing 2's bottom line is mostly below the screen,
  so its shimmer only shows in the bottom-right corner.
- **Tap icon**: three motions were shown (Press, Finger to ripple, Soft
  pulse); **Soft pulse** was chosen. The designer supplied the hand SVG.
  Ripple colour is **egg yolk** `#ffcc40`, added to the brand colours
  as an accent only. No background or "Tap anywhere to begin" text in
  the component. The ripple was made much bigger (three sizes shown,
  **A** chosen), then given **two rings**. Centring the ripple on the
  hand was tried; it comes from the **index fingertip** instead. The
  hand was first centred in a square frame; that left empty space
  below it, so the frame is now **cropped tight** to the hand and the
  largest ring (no padding).
- **Colour-style bug (fixed)**: changing a colour property to one of the
  project's colour styles produced unrelated neon colours, because the
  colour reader took digits from the style's token id. It now reads the
  style's real colour, and short hex too.
