/**
 * TutorialTargets
 *
 * Code Overrides that tag one specific layer instance with a
 * data-tutorial-target attribute for TutorialOverlay.tsx to find and
 * measure. Nothing else about the layer is touched — no style, size,
 * or position changes — this only adds the attribute.
 *
 * Because a Code Override applies to the single instance you assign it
 * to (right panel → Code → Override), not to the Main Component, this
 * can't leak onto other instances of the same component on other
 * pages, and it never requires detaching.
 *
 * Usage: select the "more-tab" layer on the canvas → Code (right
 * panel) → Override → this file → MoreTabTarget.
