# Tutorials — Notes

The interactive tutorial system, split into independent subgroups.

## `tutorials-main-page/`

Builds the Tutorials landing page itself.

- `CurvedCarouselV2.tsx` — the curved/arc card carousel that holds the
  flip-card tutorial entries. Current version (fixes the front-card
  reset firing mid-drag). The superseded V1, `CurvedCarousel.tsx`, has
  moved to `archived/tutorials-main-page/` — see `archived/NOTES.md`.

## `tutorial-overlays/`

A guided-walkthrough layer droppable on top of any existing page to
turn it into a tutorial. The real, already-interactive UI underneath is
left completely untouched — these components dim/spotlight it and
restrict taps to one target at a time instead of letting the user click
anywhere else on the page.

- `FocusGuide.tsx` — "click here" glow drawn over one specific layer
- `SpotlightOverlay.tsx` — dims/blurs the rest of the screen, cutting
  out the target area
- `TutorialOverlay.tsx` — the per-step instruction card + hole + glow
  (one instance per tutorial beat, configured entirely from the
  Properties panel)
- `TutorialTargets.tsx` — Override that tags a layer so
  `TutorialOverlay` can find/measure it
- `TutorialCongrats.tsx` — full-screen finish screen for the end of a
  tutorial

## `card-controls-tutorial/`

Tutorial-specific duplicates of individual `card-controls/` base-page
components — only the ones that actually need to behave differently
inside the tutorial flow, not a full copy of the folder. See
`card-controls-tutorial/NOTES.md`.

- `SetTravelNoticeTutorial.tsx` — duplicate of
  `card-controls/travel-notice/SetTravelNotice.tsx`, with every field
  pre-populated and frozen (fixed dates/destinations, no dropdowns).
- `TravelNoticeTutorial.tsx` — duplicate of
  `card-controls/travel-notice/TravelNoticeSection.tsx`.
- `TravelNoticeToast.tsx` is deliberately *not* duplicated here — the
  tutorial flow uses `card-controls/travel-notice/TravelNoticeToast.tsx`
  directly. See `card-controls-tutorial/NOTES.md`.

More `<group>-tutorial/` subfolders (e.g. `money-management-tutorial/`)
will show up here the same way, as tutorial work needs them.
